        <p> Artificial intelligence (AI) is the ability of machines to perform tasks that are typically
            associated with human intelligence, such as learning and problem-solving. AI applications include 
            advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search), recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, 
            and Netflix), understanding human speech (such as Siri and Alexa), self-driving cars (e.g., Waymo), 
            generative or creative tools (ChatGPT and AI art), and competing at the highest level in strategic games 
            (such as chess and Go).[1]
            Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956.[2] 
            The field went through multiple cycles of optimism[3][4] followed by disappointment and loss of 
            funding,[5][6] but after 2012, when deep learning surpassed all previous AI techniques,[7] there 
            was a vast increase in funding and interest.</p>
